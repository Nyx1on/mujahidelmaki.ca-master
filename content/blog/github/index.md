# How Github Desktop Makes Project Management Easy

Github Desktop is a powerful tool for managing software development projects that can help developers of all levels keep track of changes and collaborate with others on their code. In this post, we'll explore some of the key features of GitHub Desktop and how I use it to organize my projects and repositories.

### What is Github Desktop?

as per the name, its a desktop version of GitHub. Why is this useful? well think of a time when you had to keep searching up github.com to pull remote code into local computers. Or all the times you had to check if your repositories are connected. Github desktop allows you to keep track of all these things in an easy to use visual app.

### Making New Repositories

hands down my favourite feature is how easy it is to initalize a new repo without having to do all the commands in the terminal.
